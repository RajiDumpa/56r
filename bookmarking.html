    “Hi, I am Rajeswari. I am from addanki,A.P. I completed my English Honors from Hindu College which is affiliated to Delhi University. I completed my twelfth grade from Geethanjali junior School with 89% from CBSE Boards.

My family includes my father who is an farming, my mother who is a housewife and my brother who is pursuing his MS in Computer Science from Cornell University. I love playing chess and have represented my school in various district and state level chess competitions.

I am also a part of Rotary Club where I have participated in community service at various schools teaching the underprivileged and visiting a number of old age homes. Being part of the Rotary Club has given me a different perspective of life which makes me appreciate what I am and where I am.”
   
   Talking about my profession, now I am qualified computer programmer where I work on various programming languages such as C, Java, PHP, JavaScript, C++, Python, Shell, Ruby, Objective-C and C#. Besides my work and academic, I am extremely passionate about playing Guitar, which is a great stress-buster for me.”
